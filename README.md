# AI & ML Learning Path: Complete Video Index
This repo is a curated roadmap of AI/ML/DL learning resources. Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute.
A carefully sequenced collection of the best AI/ML/DL video playlists
for complete learning - from foundations to advanced implementations.

## Learning Path Overview

1.  **Machine Learning Foundations** - Start here for core ML concepts,
    data prep, and classical algorithms\
2.  **API Development & Deployment** - Learn to build and deploy ML
    models via APIs\
3.  **Natural Language Processing** - Master text data and NLP
    techniques\
4.  **Deep Learning Fundamentals** - Neural networks from basics to
    advanced architectures\
5.  **Building Neural Networks from Scratch** - The Karpathy way of
    truly understanding NNs
